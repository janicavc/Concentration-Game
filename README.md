# Concentration Game



## Objective and Rules
To win the game the player must pair all of the colors correctly. To start the game the player will select a card, once the first card is chosen the player will select a second card. If the cards are the same color they will become a pair and if the cards are not the same color that will count as a wrong guess towards the player. The player gets 3 wrong guesses until it's game over!
